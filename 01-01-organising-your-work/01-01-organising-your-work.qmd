## Week 1: What are we trying to do? 

- Data science is a _collaborative discipline_ 

- Be a good collaborator, to others and to your future self 

- This week will show one framework to help you with that task 

- Like flossing not difficult but requires discipline 

- We will take an opinionated and R focused approach, ideas transfer to other settings.

 - Sounds easy, but in practice it is not.

<br>

 - Requires prospective project scoping.

<br>

- Entropy is ever increasing.

## Properties of a well organised project

<br>

Ideally, we would like to organise our projects so that they are:

<br>

::::{.incremental}
:::{.fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Portable
- Version control friendly
- Reproducible
- Integrated Development Environment friendly
:::
::::

## Portability

Is your work all in one place or scattered?

Can it be moved to a new location without breaking?

What do we mean by a new location, exactly?

## Version Control Friendly 

<br>

## Reproducible 

<br>
<br>

> A study is <em>reproducible</em> if <u>you</u> can take <u>the original data and the computer code</u> used to analyze the data and <u>recreate all of the numerical findings</u> from the study.
> <br><br>

## Integrated Development Environment Friendly 

- Possible to code and manage projects entirely in notepad or at the command line.

- Puts a lot of strain on you, both your fingers and your brain 

- Integrated development environments such as RStudio, PyCharm and VisualStudio aim to reduce this burden 

  - Autocomplete / shortcodes
  - Environment panes
  - Templating

### Summary 

<br> 

- Introduced a standardised project structure;

<br>

- Good starting point for most data science projects;

<br>

- Exceptions are __apps__ and __packages__.
