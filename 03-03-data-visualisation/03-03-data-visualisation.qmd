## More Than A Pretty Picture

Visualisation is a key skill in your data science tool kit:

- Rapidly explore data sets 

- Model evaluation and diagnostics 

- Sharing evidence 

- Telling compelling stories. 

_Reflective exercise, not a tutorial or rulebook._

:::{.notes}
Data visualisation is an integral part of your work as a data scientist. 

You'll use visualisations to rapidly explore new data sets, to understand their structure and to establish which types of model might be suitable for the task at hand. Visualisation is also vital during model evaluation and when check the validity of the assumptions on which that model is based. These are relatively technical uses of visualisation, but graphics have a much broader role within your work of an effective data scientist. 

When well designed, plots, tables and animations can tell compelling stories that were once trapped within your data. They can also intuitively communicate the strength of evidence for your findings and draw attention to the most salient parts your argument. 

Data visualisation is an amalgamation of science, statistics, graphic design and storytelling. It's multi-disciplinary nature means that we have to draw on all of our skills to ensure success. 

While there are certainly many ways to go wrong when visualising data, there are many more ways to get it right. This video won't be a a step-by-step tutorial of how to visualise any type of data - that is simply not possible. Nor will it be a line-up of visualisations gone wrong. Instead, I hope to pose some questions that'll get you thinking critically about exactly what you want from each graphic that you produce.

Example visualisation tools: 

__Physical__ 
- pen and paper
- physical objects like loge
- connect-four donation counters in big transparent containers

__Digital__
- Drawing tools like Photoshop or inkscape
- More data focused, point and click tools like excel's graph creator or tableau. Good for visualising larger quantities of data that you wouldn't want to do by hand. Not reproducible without extensive documentation explaining how a graphic was created. 
- Scripting based approaches: write code to make your plots. Many approaches to this, even within a single programming language. 
- Benefit of working programmatically is that visualisation becomes a part of your reproducible workflow, the scales easily to large data sets and easy to alter if any changes are required. 
- Downside is that there is a relatively steep learning curve, that point-and-click methods avoid. 

No matter how you produce your visualisations, the time-cost to develop your skills in that medium buys you the ability to achieve greater levels of control and customisation. This upfront time investment will also make you faster at producing future graphics in that medium.  

Whenever you approach a new visualisation problem, you should pick your tools and medium judiciously. You have to balance your immediate need for speed, accuracy and reproducibility against your current skill level and improving those skills in the medium to long term.

### Titles
Give additional context or identify key findings. Active titles are preferable.

:::{.notes}
__Captions__ 
Captions are short descriptions of a visualisation, usually displayed directly above or below the figure or table that it describes. Captions serve two purposes: in a report, the caption can be used to look up the visualisation from a list of figures or tables. The second purpose of a caption is to add additional detail that you don't want to add to the plot directly. For example "Time series of GDP in the United States of America, 2017-2022. Lines show daily (solid), monthly (dashed) and five-year (dotted) mean values."

__Alt-text__ 
Alt text or alternative text is used to describe the content of an image to a person who can't view it. This text is helpful for people with a visual impairment, particularly those who uses a screen reader. Screen reading software reads digital text out loud but can't interpret images. Such software replaces the image with the provided alternative text. Alt text is also valuable in cases when the image can't be found or loaded, for example because of an incorrect file path or a slow internet connection.

The purpose of alt-text is different from a caption. It's designed as a replacement for the image, not just a shorthand or to provide additional information. If there is an important trend or conclusion to be drawn from the visualisation (that is not already mentioned in the main text) this should be identified in the alt-text. This sort of interpretation is a key aspect of alt-text that shouldn't be included in a caption. 

__Titles__ 
Titles give additional context that is not conveyed by the axis labels or chart annotations. Alternatively the title can be used like a newspaper headline to deliver the key findings of the visualisation. One example of this might be when looking at a visualisation that is composed of many smaller plots, each showing the GDP for a US state over the last five years. Title for each smaller plot would identify the state it is describing, while the overall title might be something like "All US states have increased GDP in the period 2017-2022".

If you are including this type of interpretive title, make sure that the same interpretation is clear in the alt-text.

## Standardise and document it

Decisions cost time, energy and money. (DRY)

<br>

Consider your design choices carefully and write down your decisions and reasoning. (DRY)
